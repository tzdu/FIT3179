        <h1>Cost of Living in Australia</h1>
        <p>
          The cost of living is a crucial factor that affects the quality of life and economic stability for individuals and families across Australia. 
          It encompasses the expenses required to maintain a standard of living, including housing, groceries, healthcare, transportation, and other essential services. 
          Understanding the cost of living can provide insights into economic disparities between regions, the affordability of different areas, and how economic policies impact daily life.
          <br><br>
          In Australia, the cost of living varies significantly across states and territories, driven by factors such as population density, housing availability, wage levels, and regional 
          economic activities. Major urban centers like Sydney and Melbourne are often considered more expensive compared to regional areas, but even within states, there are substantial differences. 
          These variations can have a profound impact on people's choices, influencing where they live, work, and spend.

    <h2>Cost of Living in Different States</h2>
    <p>
      The analysis of the CPI-to-Wage Ratio across Australian states reveals important insights into the cost of living and purchasing 
      power of residents. This ratio allows for comparison of the cost of living, as represented by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) across
      different states. A lower ratio suggests that wages are higher relative to the cost of living, indicating better financial comfort 
      for residents. 
      <br><br>
      Western Australia (WA) has the lowest CPI-to-Wage Ratio at 0.066, reflecting higher wages relative to living costs, 
      likely due to high-paying industries such as mining. In contrast, South Australia (SA) shows the highest ratio at 0.079, suggesting 
      that wages are lower in comparison to living expenses, which may create tighter financial conditions for residents. States like 
      New South Wales (NSW), Victoria (VIC), and Queensland (QLD) have ratios that fall between these extremes, indicating moderate 
      cost-of-living pressures. 
      <br><br>
      These differences highlight the economic diversity across Australia, where urban centers might sustain 
      higher wages to balance living costs, while states with less robust economies may struggle to keep wages aligned with inflation. 
      Addressing these disparities through wage growth, cost-of-living adjustments, or other economic measures is crucial for ensuring 
      financial stability and well-being across all regions.

        <h2>Wage vs CPI Growth</h2>
        <p>
          The relationship between CPI and wages is crucial in understanding the cost of living and economic health of Australia. 
          From the data, the trend of wages outpacing CPI in 2014 suggests a period where Australians were able to cope well with 
          living expenses, leading to easier cost of living. 
          <br><br>
          However, regional disparities indicate that not all areas 
          experienced the same benefits, as seen in 2014 where ACT droopped in wages but WA had a significant increase, reflecting 
          the complex economic dynamics within the country. Additionally, the growth of CPI has been far steeper than wage growth
          across all states, indicating the inability of wages to keep up with the cost of living, leading to less disposable income
          for Australians. 
          <br><br>
          This is why it is essential to monitor these indicators, as they help in crafting policies that promote 
          sustainable wage growth and manage inflation, ultimately aiming to enhance the standard of living for Australians.

    <h2>Relationship between Population, Cost of Living and Wages</h2>
    <p>
      The relationship between population size and cost of living across Australian states reveals how higher populations 
      can influence economic dynamics. 
      <br><br>
      In more populous states like New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria (VIC), the larger 
      population can lead to increased demand for goods, services, and especially housing, driving up the overall cost of 
      living. While economies of scale in these states help moderate the CPI to population ratios, 
      urban centers like Sydney and Melbourne still face significant price pressures, making them some of the most expensive areas 
      to live in Australia. 
      <br><br>
      Conversely, in less populated states such as South Australia (SA) and Tasmania (TAS), the smaller population results 
      in a higher CPI to population ratio, reflecting higher per capita costs due to reduced economies of scale and 
      less competition. Additionally they are the two states with the lowest weekly wages, highlighting the significant cost of living
      in those states. 
      <br><br>
      On the other hand, states such as Western Australia (WA) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), with mid-range ratios,
      but relatively high wages, illustrates 
      how a balanced yet smaller population, supported by a strong economic base, can sustain wages and cost of living without 
      extreme disparities.
